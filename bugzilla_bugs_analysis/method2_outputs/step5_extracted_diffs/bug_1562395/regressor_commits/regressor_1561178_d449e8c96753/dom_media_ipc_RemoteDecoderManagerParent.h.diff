# Description:
#   Bug 1561178 - Use Endpoints for VideoBridge construction, and support the possibility that there are multiple at the same time. r=jya
#   
#   In the future we're going to want VideoBridge connections from the RDD process into both the parent process and the GPU process.
#   This does the preparation work for unifying the way we create VideoBridges (using Endpoints, required for cross-process connections),
#   and detects which one to use based on where the video will be composited.
