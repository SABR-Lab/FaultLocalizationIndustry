 #if defined(WCHAR_T_IS_UTF16)
 
+// Define a macro for wrapping construction of char16 arrays and string16s from
+// a literal string. This indirection allows for an easier migration of
+// base::char16 to char16_t on platforms where WCHAR_T_IS_UTF16, as only a one
+// character change to the macro will be necessary.
+// This macro does not exist when WCHAR_T_IS_UTF32, as it is currently not
+// possible to create a char array form a literal in this case.
+// TODO(https://crbug.com/911896): Remove this macro once base::char16 is
+// char16_t on all platforms.
