# Regressor Bug: 1583700

# Description:
#   Bug 1583700 - Create a new ClientSource from a parent-allocated ClientInfo even for same-origin redirects, since there might have been a prior cross-origin redirect. r=perry,asuth
#   
#   We fail navigation-redirect.https.html?client without this (with the subtest to redirects to a cross-origin page and then redirects back again to a same-origin page). In this case the ClientChannelHelper running in the child only sees a same-origin redirect (the first URL to the final one), but we've still allocated a new ClientInfo in the parent and we want to create the corresponding ClientSource.
