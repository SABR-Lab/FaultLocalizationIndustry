# Description:
#   Bug 1382922 - Refactor event queue to allow multiple implementations (r=erahm)
#   
#   This patch refactors the nsThread event queue to clean it up and to make it easier to restructure. The fundamental concepts are as follows:
#   
#   Each nsThread will have a pointer to a refcounted SynchronizedEventQueue. A SynchronizedEQ takes care of doing the locking and condition variable work when posting and popping events. For the actual storage of events, it delegates to an AbstractEventQueue data structure. It keeps a UniquePtr to the AbstractEventQueue that it uses for storage.
