# Description:
#   Bug 1600207 - Make GetInner()/GetLegend() robust also in presence of additional continuations on the principal child list.  r=TYLin
#   
#   Also, don't drain OverflowList unless we need to.
#   And make EnsureChildContinuation deal with continuations going from being
#   normal continuations to overflow-continuations (and vice versa) better.
