# Description:
#   Bug 1535617: Part 2 - Clear weak references for most cycle collected objects on unlink. r=mccr8
#   
#   This covers most cycle collected objects which support weak references, but
#   not the ones which inherit from a cycle collected class and don't do any cycle
#   collection on their own.
