# Description:
#   Bug 1580565 - Part 4: Use WindowContext to manage BrowsingContext cached status, r=farre
#   
#   The existing infrastructure which stored cached BrowsingContexts on the
#   BrowsingContextGroup was added before WindowContexts were added, and can cause
#   racing issues with partially discarded trees during process switches.
