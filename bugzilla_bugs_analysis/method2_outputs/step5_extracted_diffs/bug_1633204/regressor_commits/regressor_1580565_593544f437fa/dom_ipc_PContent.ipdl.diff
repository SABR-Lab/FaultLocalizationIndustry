# Description:
#   Bug 1580565 - Part 6: Add a unique ID to each BrowsingContextGroup, r=kmag
#   
#   This allows us to explicitly specify BrowsingContextGroups when synchronizing
#   them. A major advantage of this is that it means we can handle an attempt to
#   create a BrowsingContext with a parent which the content process is unaware of,
