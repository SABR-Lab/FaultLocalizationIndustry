# Regressor Bug: 1556556
# File Overlap Count: 1
# Description:
#   Bug 1556556 - Move GetCallbackTransform() into a new ViewportUtils class. r=kats
#   
#   This function (and helper functions that wrap it) will be used extensively
#   throughout layout code, so keeping it in APZCCallbackHelper seems awkward.

-       2. A translation representing async scrolling. This can contain:
-           - For any scroll frame, a scroll component resulting from the main
-             thread incompletely applying an APZ-requested scroll position.
-           - For the RCD-RSF only, a persistent component representing the
-             offset of the visual viewport relative to the layout viewport.
-         The translation is accumulated for all scroll frames form |aScrollId|
-         up to the root, using values populated in UpdateCallbackTransform. See
-         that method's documentation for additional details. */
