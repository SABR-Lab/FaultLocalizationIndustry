# Description:
#   Bug 1640019 - Part 1: Support toplevel process switches outside of tabbrowser, r=mattwoodrow
#   
#   This new process switching behavior is only enabled for some browser elements,
#   which have specified a specific attribute. Turning this on for all browsers with
#   a `remote` attribute causes breakage in reftests.
