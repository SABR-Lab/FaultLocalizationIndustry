# Regressor Bug: 1637500
# File Overlap Count: 2
# Description:
#   Bug 1637500 - P2. Rename methods as they are not always dealing with "threads". r=froydnj
#   
#   Before P1, GetCurrentThreadSerialEventTarget would have always returned the same data as NS_GetCurrentThread, making the comment incorrect Now it will properly return the running TaskQueue if any.
#   
#   This change of name more clearly exposes what they are doing, as we aren't always dealing with threads directly; but a nsISerialEventTarget
