# Description:
#   Bug 1636728 - Make calling window.print() before load keep deferring the actual printing and closing the window until load. r=smaug
#   
#   Other engines also do this, but with my previous patch breaks it
#   (because we only hit print() on the print-content-viewer _after_ doing
#   the clone).
