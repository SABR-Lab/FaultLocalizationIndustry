# Regressor Bug: 1636728
# File Overlap Count: 1
# Description:
#   Bug 1667342 - Make the "deferred window close" keep making sense after bug 1636728. r=smaug
#   
#   This was only being checked on OnDonePrinting() which isn't called in
#   the original docshell. Move it to the window because we don't need to
#   care about document viewers getting closed during print operations,
