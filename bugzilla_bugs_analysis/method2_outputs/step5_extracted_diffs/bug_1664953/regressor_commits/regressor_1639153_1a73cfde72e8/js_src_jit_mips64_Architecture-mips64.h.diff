# Description:
#   Bug 1639153 - Introduce indirect stubs to optimize call_indirect. r=lth
#   
#   This patch introduces indirect stubs.
#   An indirect stub is a stub that takes care of any switching activities needed for call_indirect.
#   Before this patch, we have to conservatively assume that any call_indirect's target can be from a foreign instance,
