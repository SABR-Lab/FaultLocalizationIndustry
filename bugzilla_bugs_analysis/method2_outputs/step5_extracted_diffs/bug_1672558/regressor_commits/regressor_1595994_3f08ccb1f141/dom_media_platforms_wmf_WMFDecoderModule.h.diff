# Description:
#   Bug 1674043 - P6. Remove sync PDecoderMananger::Supports API. r=mattwoodrow,bryce,mjf,ipc-reviewers,nika
#   
#   In bug 1595994 we attempted to streamline the ability to determine which decoder was available regardless of the process they would be running in. This was subsequently done via the PDMFactory.
#   
#   As there are several JS API that can query which codec are supported, it requires a synchronous mechanism.
