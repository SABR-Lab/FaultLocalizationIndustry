# Description:
#   Bug 1674922 - Cleanup ReadSegments: r=necko-reviewers,kershaw
#   
#   - Move looping while calling mTransaction->ReadSegments into Http3Stream and call mTransaction->ReadSegmentsAgain. We use to loop in Http3Session which was not easy because it is not easy to find out when to leave the loop. The original code was working, but this is a better way to do this.
#   - Remove mReadyForWriteButBlocked it is not necessary, it was used only as a double check and can only be a source of bugs.
#   - Remove mContentBytesWritten, because it is not used.
