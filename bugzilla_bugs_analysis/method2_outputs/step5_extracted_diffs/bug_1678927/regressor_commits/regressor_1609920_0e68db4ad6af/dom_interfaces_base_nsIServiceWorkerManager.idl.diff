# Description:
#   Bug 1609920 - part 1: Allow the WebExtension Framework to register a moz-extension service worker. r=dom-workers-and-storage-reviewers,asuth,mixedpuppy
#   
#   - Adds the new about:config pref "extensions.backgroundServiceWorker.enabled" (currently defaults to false).
#   - Adds the background.service_worker property to the manifest JSON schema definition
#   - Locks background.service_worker manifest property behind the new preference
