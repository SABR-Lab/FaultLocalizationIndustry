# Description:
#   Bug 1699364 - Re-add special case pre-barrier for rope flattening r=sfink
#   
#   It turns out that patch for bug 1698543 was too optimistic and we need the special case barrier for rope flattening for another reason: during flattening rope nodes are transformed before their ancestors.  Interior rope nodes are transformed to dependent strings with the base being the root node, and the root transformed into a linear string. Since the root is changed last the GC graph is not safe to traverse until flattening has finished.
#   
#   This makes the test case pass.  I added this test case and the one for the previous bug.  I don't think we need to hide these since this change has only been on nightly so far.
