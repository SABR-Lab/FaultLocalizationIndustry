# Regressor Bug: 1382886
# File Overlap Count: 1
# Description:
#   Bug 1382886 - Remove a busy-wait if the early-data is negotiated and http/1.1 is used but the transaction cannot send early-data. r=necko-reviewers,kershaw
#   
#   In this case necko should poll for read (not for write) and reset the poll flags when the handshake is done.
#   The other option is to inspect the resumption ticket before adding it to the nss socket and find out which alpn will be used and disable the early-data if the version is http/1.1 and the transaction cannot send early-data. This currently only works on Nightly. When we roll out the necko’s token cache we can consider making this change.
