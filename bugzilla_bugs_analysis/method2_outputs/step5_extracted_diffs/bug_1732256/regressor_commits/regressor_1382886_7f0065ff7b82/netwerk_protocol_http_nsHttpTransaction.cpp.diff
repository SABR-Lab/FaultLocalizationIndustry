# Description:
#   Bug 1382886 - Fix fuzzing build, also we cannot set SecurityInfo during read r=necko-reviewers,kershaw
#   
#   Before this bug TLS handshake was only driven by forcing writes. SecurtyInfo was set during a write code path. That is not anymore true and the TLS handshake can be driven by reading from a socket. That causes an issue where the SecurtyInfo was not set in case a TLS handshake fails. This bug added the setting of the SecurtyInfo to the read code path, but that causes problems when the transaction is closed due to corrupted response.
#   This patch fixes this by moving the setting of SecurtyInfo to Close() function.
