# Description:
#   Bug 1744520: Fix OOM handling for variadic instructions r=jandem
#   
#   Variadic instructions contain a FixedList of operands which is initialized fallibly in MVariadicT::init. This means MFoo::New is fallible for variadic instructions. A fuzz bug found one unhandled OOM in scalar replacement. I did a quick survey of places where we create new variadic nodes, and found a few more latent bugs that I introduced in my patches to scalar-replace arguments. I fixed those bugs and added a comment on MVariadicInstruction in the hopes of avoiding the same mistake in the future.
#   
#   I'm not adding the fuzz testcase, because OOM tests of Ion internals are incredibly fragile and will stop working as soon as we add or remove one more allocation somewhere.
