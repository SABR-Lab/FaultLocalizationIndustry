# Description:
#   Bug 1713579: Extract shape-guard folding into separate optimization r=jandem
#   
#   This patch takes the code from `MGuardShape::foldsTo` and splits it out into its own optimization. Besides jitspew, the main change is adding support for MNewPlainObject (which didn't exist when this code was first written.)
#   
#   We use `dependency()` to find the most recent store. It is possible for a node's dependency to be in a dead block. In `ValueNumberer::visitDefinition`, we check for this case; I used the same approach here.
