-spirv-headers of the rspirv project
-===================================
-
-[![Crate][img-crate-headers]][crate-headers]
-[![Documentation][img-doc-headers]][doc-headers]
-
-The headers crate for the rspirv project which provides Rust definitions of
-SPIR-V structs, enums, and constants.
-
-Usage
------
-
-This project uses associated constants, which became available in the stable channel
-since [1.20][rust-1.20]. So to compile with a compiler from the stable channel,
-please make sure that the version is >= 1.20.
-
-First add to your `Cargo.toml`:
-
-```toml
-[dependencies]
-spirv_headers = "1.5"
-```
-
-Then add to your crate root:
-
-```rust
-extern crate spirv_headers;
-```
-
-Version
--------
-
-Note that the major and minor version of this create is tracking the SPIR-V spec,
-while the patch number is used for bugfixes for the crate itself. So version
-`1.4.2` is tracking SPIR-V 1.4 but not necessarily revision 2. Major client APIs
-like Vulkan/OpenCL pin to a specific major and minor version, regardless of the
-revision.
-
-Examples
---------
-
-Please see the [documentation][doc-headers] and project's
-[README][project-readme] for examples.
