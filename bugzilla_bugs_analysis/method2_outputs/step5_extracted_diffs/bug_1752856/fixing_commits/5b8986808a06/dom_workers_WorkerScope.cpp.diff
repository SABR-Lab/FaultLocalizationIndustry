# Description:
#   Bug 1752856 - Null CheckedUnsafePtr<WorkerPrivate> for members of WorkerGlobalScope when releaseing WorkerPrivate. r=dom-worker-reviewers,asuth,smaug
#   
#   In some unusual cases, WorkerGlobalScope could live longer than WorkerPrivate since some other objects hold a reference on WorkerGlobalScope. We try to use CC/GC to release WorkerGlobalScope and force disconnect them from the WorkerPrivate before releasing WorkerPrivate. https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/83b86005c6913c2062419efb8aabdf2e683aa47f/dom/workers/RuntimeService.cpp#2068-2109
#   
#   The previous implementation focused on nulling the WorkerGlobalScopeBase::mWorkerPrivate. However, it is not enough since WorkerGlobalScope's member could possibly hold a CheckedUnsafePtr<WorkerPrivate>, i.e. WorkerGlobalScope::mPerformance.
