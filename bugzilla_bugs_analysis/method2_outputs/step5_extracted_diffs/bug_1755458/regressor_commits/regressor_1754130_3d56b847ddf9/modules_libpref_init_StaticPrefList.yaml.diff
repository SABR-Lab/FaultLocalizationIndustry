# Description:
#   Bug 1754130 - Implement SharedContext for sharing WebGL state among many DrawTargetWebgls. r=aosmond
#   
#   Within DrawTargetWebgl, this implements a SharedContext class to store both the WebGL context and
#   also related resources for drawing with it. Not a lot of new code has actually been added as this
#   was mostly accomplished by refactoring as much drawing code as possible that touched the WebGL
