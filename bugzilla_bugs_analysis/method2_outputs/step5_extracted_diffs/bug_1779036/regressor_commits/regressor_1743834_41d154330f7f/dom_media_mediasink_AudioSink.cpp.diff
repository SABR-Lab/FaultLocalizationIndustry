# Description:
#   Bug 1743834 - Trigger the audibility event at the beginning of the initialization of an audio stream, when un-muting. r=alwu
#   
#   The initialization itself can take some time and this audibility event is used
#   to prioritize the process, that will soon become audible, on at least Windows,
#   so it's better to get prioritized slightly ahead of time.
