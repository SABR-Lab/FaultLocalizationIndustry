# Regressor Bug: 1777426
# File Overlap Count: 2
# Description:
#   Bug 1777426 - Support fast readbacks in CopyToSwapChain with async present. r=sotaro,jgilbert
#   
#   Currently CopyToSwapChain creates spurious copies of the back buffer when SharedSurfaces aren't exportable (= ToSurfaceDescriptor returns Nothing from SharedSurface_Basic). These then later get read back into a CPU memory buffer when PresentFrontBufferToCompositor is used to send the buffer to RemoteTextureMap. This has associated performance and memory costs.
#   
#   Conceptually, we want Present/CopyToSwapChain to just do the right thing and automatically push buffers to RemoteTextureMap, rather than secondarily needing a hidden call to PresentFrontBufferToCompositor. Then we can get rid of the need to create front buffers whose only purpose is to shuttle data to PresentFrontBufferToCompositor which then shuttles it RemoteTextureMap.
