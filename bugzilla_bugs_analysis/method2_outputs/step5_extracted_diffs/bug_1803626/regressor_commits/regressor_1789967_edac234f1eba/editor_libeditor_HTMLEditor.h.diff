# Description:
#   Bug 1789967 - part 1: Make `TextEditor` and `HTMLEditor` implement `EditorBase::InitEditorContentAndSelection` by themselves r=m_kato
#   
#   The method is enough simple, and uses bad cast from point of view of OOP.
#   Therefore, this patch make the sub classes implement the method only for each.
