# Description:
#   Bug 1749380 - Part 2 - Performance and quality fixes for part 1. r=gfx-reviewers,nical
#   
#   * Add support for local scale factors to a surface, allowing it to
#     be rasterized in root coordinate space. This allows snapping to
#     work across surfaces where the surface transform is a fractional
