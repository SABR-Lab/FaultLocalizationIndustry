# Description:
#   Bug 1839070 - Emit a start point if close is called immediately after move_to. r=jrmuizel
#   
#   wpf-gpu-raster would blindly modify the last point type in a path when call was closed, even
#   if move_to preceded it directly and outputted no actual point type. In this case, we need to
#   ensure that we emit a start point if close is called immediately after move_to.
