# Description:
#   Bug 1863914: Use multiple shmem buffers for remote canvas recording. r=aosmond
#   
#   This replaces the use of a single large ring buffer.
#   The buffers are still processed in parallel and are recycled to reduce
#   allocation. Events that do not fit in the default sized buffer have a separate
