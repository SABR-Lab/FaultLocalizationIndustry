+// Tell the profiler to look up the download directory for writing profiles.
+// With some features, such as signal control, we need to know the location of
+// a directory where we can save profiles to disk. Because we start the
+// profiler before we start the directory service, we can't access the
+// download directory at profiler startup. Similarly, when we need to get the
+// directory, we often can't, as we're running in non-main-thread contexts
+// that don't have access to the directory service. This function gives us a
+// third option, by giving us a hook to look for the download directory when
+// the time is right. This might be triggered internally (e.g. when we start
+// profiling), or externally, e.g. after the directory service is initialised.
