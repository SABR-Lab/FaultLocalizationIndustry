# Description:
#   Bug 1892644 - Handling WorkerThreadRunnable::Run() after Worker is "Dead". r=asuth
#   
#   In bug 1769913, we remove the WorkerThreadRunnable's raw pointer to the corresponding WorkerPrivate and expect the corresponding WorkerPrivate to be obtained by GetCurrentThreadWorkerPrivate() when WorkerThreadRunnable::Run executing.
#   
#   In general, the assumption is correct. However, it could be violated in the following two situations.
