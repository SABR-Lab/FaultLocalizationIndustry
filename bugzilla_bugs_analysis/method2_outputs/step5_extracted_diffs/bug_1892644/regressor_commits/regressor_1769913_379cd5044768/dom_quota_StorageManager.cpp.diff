# Regressor Bug: 1769913
# File Overlap Count: 3
# Description:
#   Bug 1769913 - P1 Make WorkerRunnable to be a base class for runnables on Worker thread and Worker's parent thread. r=dom-worker-reviewers,asuth
#   
#   This is the first step in splitting the parent thread runnable out of WorkerRunnable.
#   
#   To reuse the runnable dispatching codes in Worker, we still need a base class for runnable on the worker thread and the parent thread.
