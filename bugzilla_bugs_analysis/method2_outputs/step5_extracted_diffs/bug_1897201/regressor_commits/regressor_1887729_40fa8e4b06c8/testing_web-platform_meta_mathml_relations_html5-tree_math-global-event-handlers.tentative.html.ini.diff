# Description:
#   Bug 1887729 - Implement context lost/restored support for CanvasRenderingContext2D. r=webidl,gfx-reviewers,smaug,lsalzman
#   
#   Remote canvas can run in the GPU process, and if the GPU process
#   crashes, we need to notify the application using canvas. Historically we
#   just failed, and the application may have been able to continue drawing
