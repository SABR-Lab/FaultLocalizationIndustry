+# Cairo: Multi-platform 2D graphics library
+
+<https://cairographics.org>
+
+What is cairo
+-------------
+
+Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
+devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
+System (via both Xlib and XCB), quartz, win32, and image buffers,
+as well as PDF, PostScript, and SVG file output.
+
+Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
+while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available
+(for example, through the X Render Extension).
+
+The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
+PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo include stroking and filling
+cubic Bézier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images,
+and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be
+transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear,
+etc.).
+
+Cairo has been designed to let you draw anything you want in a modern
+2D graphical user interface.  At the same time, the cairo API has been
+designed to be as fun and easy to learn as possible. If you're not
+having fun while programming with cairo, then we have failed
+somewhere---let us know and we'll try to fix it next time around.
+
+Cairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or
+modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public
+License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version
+1.1.

+
+Dependencies
+------------
+
+The set of libraries needed to compile cairo depends on which backends are
+enabled when cairo is configured. So look at the list below to determine
+which dependencies are needed for the backends of interest.
+
+For the surface backends, we have both "supported" and "experimental"
+backends. Further, the supported backends can be divided into the "standard"
+backends which can be easily built on any platform, and the "platform"
+backends which depend on some underlying platform-specific system, (such as
+the X Window System or some other window system).
+
+As an example, for a standard Linux build similar to what's shipped by your
+distro, (with image, png, pdf, PostScript, svg, and xlib surface backends,
+and the freetype font backend), the following sample commands will install
+necessary dependencies:
+
+- Debian (and similar):
+  - `apt-get build-dep cairo`
+
+- Fedora (and similar):
+  - `dnf builddep cairo`
+
+Technically you probably don't need pixman from the distribution since if
+you're manually compiling Cairo you probably want an updated pixman as well.
+However, if you follow the default settings and install pixman to
+/usr/local, your Cairo build should properly use it in preference to the
+system pixman.

+Compiling
+---------
+
+See the [`INSTALL`](./INSTALL) document for build instructions.
+
+Licensing
+---------

+
+History
+-------
+
+Cairo was originally developed by Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org> and Keith
+Packard <keithp@keithp.com>. Many thanks are due to Lyle Ramshaw without
+whose patient help our ignorance would be much more apparent.
+
+Since the original development, many more people have contributed to cairo.
+See the [`AUTHORS`](./AUTHORS) document for as complete a list as we've been
+able to compile so far.
