# Description:
#   Bug 1728331 - Part 1: Remove e10s process recycling, r=smaug
#   
#   This logic did nothing in Fission, however it did have an effect for
#   e10s-Android, which will no longer have process recycling. I expect the impact
#   of this to be minimal given Android's tendency to kill processes already.
