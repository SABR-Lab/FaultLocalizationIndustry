# Description:
#   Bug 1903977 - Add a blob tile pool. r=gfx-reviewers,gw
#   
#   The tile pool keeps a strong reference to all of its allocations and reuses them when their reference count gets down to one.
#   Jemalloc only uses thread-local arenas for small allocations (<496 bytes) so it does not matter what thread the blob tiles which are typically much larger, are deallocated in.
#
