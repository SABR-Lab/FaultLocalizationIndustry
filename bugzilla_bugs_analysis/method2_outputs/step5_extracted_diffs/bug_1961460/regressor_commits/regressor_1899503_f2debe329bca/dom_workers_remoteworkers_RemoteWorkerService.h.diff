# Description:
#   Bug 1899503 - P3 PRemoteWorkerDebugger binding implementation. r=asuth
#   
#   This patch implements the PRemoteWorkerDebugger binding.
#   
#   We are trying to keep the same logic debugger registration/unregistration to minimize the difference between the local debugger(the debugger on the content process main thread)
