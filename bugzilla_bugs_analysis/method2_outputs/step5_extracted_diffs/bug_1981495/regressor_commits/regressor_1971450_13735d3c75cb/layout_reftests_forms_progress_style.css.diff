# Description:
#   Bug 1971450 - Remove internal appearance values for meter / progress / range thumb / chunk. r=dshin
#   
#   This is technically a behavior change because we don't really look at
#   the appearance value of the progressbar etc anymore. We could do that if
#   wanted, but it's more consistent to just look at the individual frame
