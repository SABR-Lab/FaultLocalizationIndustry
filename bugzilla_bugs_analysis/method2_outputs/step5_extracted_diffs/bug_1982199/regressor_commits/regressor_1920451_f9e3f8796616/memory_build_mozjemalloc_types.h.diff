# Description:
#   Bug 1920451 - Introduce a concept of last significant re-use to decide when to purge. r=pbone,smaug
#   
#   We want to better predict when it is a good moment to purge. D220616 answered well the question, when to best process a purge when it is needed (that is, during main thread idle time), but that does not necessarily mean it is a good idea for a single arena, to purge in that moment as arenas can be used on other threads intensely while the main thread is idle.
#   
#   If we saw a recent re-use in an arena we can most likely expect to come more of that and wait with purge a little more. So whenever we are able to re-use a dirty page, we assume that this is a sign of a significant re-use that avoided an allocation of new memory.
