#   Bug 1962133 - QM: Add accessed flag to FullOriginMetadata and persist it in the origin metadata file; r=dom-storage-reviewers,hsingh
#   
#   This patch introduces a new mAccessed field in OriginStateMetadata, which is
#   inherited by FullOriginMetadata. One of the reserved 32-bit fields in the
#   metadata header is now used as a bitfield, with one bit allocated to represent
